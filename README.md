 ## Tweet Feed Analysis
   ### Introduction : 
                     Twitter Feed Analysis is a process of analysing the sentiment or emotion of tweets.
                      We can classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral based on their content with
                      the help of natural language processing and machine learning algorithm. Here I find 
                      out the sentiment, polarity and subjectivity of the tweet. Dataset link is :

   ### Model :
                   I used Random Forest Classifier for classification task as it can handle high-dimensional
                   and sparse datasets, which is common in text analysis.

 ### Output :
